    <p>This is a paragraph. This is another paragraph. The HTML code in the example above will work in most of the web browsers, but don't rely on it. Forgetting the end tag can produce unexpected results or errors.
        Note: For the purposes of forwards-compatibility and good coding practice, it's advisable to use both the opening and closing tags for the paragraphs. </p>
